# Server-to-Server-Install-Tracking
## OVERVIEW
To help launch CPI campaigns in ZPLAY Ads, we allow developers to send install tracking information via a server-to-server integration, so the advertised applications do not need to be updated to include install tracking specifically for ZPLAY Ads. This document instructs you to integrate a third party install tracking service or your own application servers to notify ZPLAY Ads of new installs in your iOS and Android games.

If you already use an external mobile install tracking service, such as AppsFlyer, Adjust, Admaster, Talking Data, More Than Data, etc. you can easily configure a Tracking URL in ZPLAY Ads to notify your install tracking service the clicks and then configure an ZPLAY Ads Postback URL in your install tracking service to notify ZPLAY Ads about the install conversions.

The ZPLAY Ads Admin Panel lets you define a Custom Tracking URL for your campaigns. This URL reports the user’s identification at impressions (or clicks) of the campaign to your install tracking service. This information is then used by the service to attribute any subsequent installs to the correct ad network and make a callback to that network with the proper user details.

Before deliver an ad, Custom Tracking URL should be testes with ZPLAY Ads.
